## Reflection
### Describe the effect each of the P, I, D components had in your implementation.
In my implementation, only P and D components were implemented. I component is designed to handle systematic bias. In this case, systematic bias is not a big issue because the track includes many curves. The controller needs update control output frequently.

The P component was selected to deal with the present CTE, it will steer the car to the right direction. Bigger coefficient help quick correction but leads to oscillation.  
The D component in my implementation was used to handle the oscillation caused by P part.

With P and D, my controller was able to drive the car in simulator successfully.

### Describe how the final hyperparameters were chosen.
In my implementation, the final hyperparameters are: Kp=0.25, Ki=0, Kd=0.5.
It is not sufficient to generate correct control outputs with the hyperparameters above only.

   
3 additional modifications were implemented:     

* Update Kp with speed input --> decrease Kp when speed becomes higher (in case of high speed, small steering input is enough to make sharp turn)
* Update Kd with speed input --> increase Kd when speed becomes higher (more easier oscillation in high speed, need bigger value)
* When steering angle is bigger than threshold --> slow down the car (slow down car in curve)

The hyperparameters were tuned in this way:     

 * Kp first, try the choose the value with which car can be steered quick enough, oscillation is acceptable
 * Add Kd, try and choose the value with which the cscillation can be eliminated.

Several runs were tested to find the suitable parameter.

There's an experimental patch for windows in this [PR](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-PID-Control-Project/pull/3)

## Basic Build Instructions

1. Clone this repo.
2. Make a build directory: `mkdir build && cd build`
3. Compile: `cmake .. && make`
4. Run it: `./pid`. 

## Editor Settings

We've purposefully kept editor configuration files out of this repo in order to
keep it as simple and environment agnostic as possible. However, we recommend
using the following settings:

* indent using spaces
* set tab width to 2 spaces (keeps the matrices in source code aligned)

## Code Style

Please (do your best to) stick to [Google's C++ style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html).

## Project Instructions and Rubric

Note: regardless of the changes you make, your project must be buildable using
cmake and make!

More information is only accessible by people who are already enrolled in Term 2
of CarND. If you are enrolled, see [the project page](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd013/parts/40f38239-66b6-46ec-ae68-03afd8a601c8/modules/f1820894-8322-4bb3-81aa-b26b3c6dcbaf/lessons/e8235395-22dd-4b87-88e0-d108c5e5bbf4/concepts/6a4d8d42-6a04-4aa6-b284-1697c0fd6562)
for instructions and the project rubric.

## Hints!

* You don't have to follow this directory structure, but if you do, your work
  will span all of the .cpp files here. Keep an eye out for TODOs.

## Call for IDE Profiles Pull Requests

Help your fellow students!

We decided to create Makefiles with cmake to keep this project as platform
agnostic as possible. Similarly, we omitted IDE profiles in order to we ensure
that students don't feel pressured to use one IDE or another.

However! I'd love to help people get up and running with their IDEs of choice.
If you've created a profile for an IDE that you think other students would
appreciate, we'd love to have you add the requisite profile files and
instructions to ide_profiles/. For example if you wanted to add a VS Code
profile, you'd add:

* /ide_profiles/vscode/.vscode
* /ide_profiles/vscode/README.md

The README should explain what the profile does, how to take advantage of it,
and how to install it.

Frankly, I've never been involved in a project with multiple IDE profiles
before. I believe the best way to handle this would be to keep them out of the
repo root to avoid clutter. My expectation is that most profiles will include
instructions to copy files to a new location to get picked up by the IDE, but
that's just a guess.

One last note here: regardless of the IDE used, every submitted project must
still be compilable with cmake and make./
